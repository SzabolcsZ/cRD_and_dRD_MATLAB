# cRD_and_dRD_MATLAB
Implementation of cRD (3D) and dRD (2D) for ocellated lizard skin patterning.
For dRD on non hexagonal lattice (real lizard voronoi diagram or perturbed hexagonal lattice diagram), run dRD_voronoi.m

---

dRD simulation:

-run 'dRD.m' (either with icJuvenile=1 or icJuvenile=0).
The data generated by the simulation is saved in a '.mat' file, and the final pattern is plotted.

---

dRD_voronoi simulation:

-run 'dRD_voronoi.m' (either with lizardDiagram=1 or lizardDiagram=0).
The data generated by the simulation is saved in a '.mat' file.

---

cRD simulation:

-run 'lizardskinLattice.m' (the mesh size in X (=Nx) and Y (=Ny) direction can be changed in the script).
The mesh is saved in '.vtk' format and '.msh' format (if gmsh is available)

-run 'cRD.m'.
The data generated is saved in a '.mat' file, and also in a '.vtk' file (final pattern on mesh).
