# cRD_and_dRD_MATLAB
Implementation of cRD (3D) and dRD (2D) for ocellated lizard skin patterning.

---

dRD simulation:

-run dRD.m (either with icJuvenile=1 or icJuvenile=0).
The data generated by the simulation is saved in a .mat file, and the final pattern is plotted.

---

cRD simulation:

-run lizardskinLattice.m (the mesh size in X (=Nx) and Y (=Ny) direction can be changed in the script).
The mesh is saved in .vtk format and .msh format (if gmsh is available)

-run cRD.m 
The data generated is saved in a .mat file, and also in a .vtk file (final pattern on mesh).
